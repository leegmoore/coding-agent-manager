inside of coding-agent-manager/docs please make a directory projects and move the 2 projects. I consider the first project the creation of the Coding Agent Manager along with the cloning and ability to remove the tool calls. I consider the second project the adding of the compression of different messages. I'd like you to make that projects folder and inside, I'd like you to make the two projects for that. And I'd like you to move just the relevant files that turned out to be relevant from the existing root projects folder for these two things. There's a lot of extra scratch pads and notes and quick reviews from agents. Probably don't need all of those. I just want a tight list of documents that show our specs and the specs we use to build those, and features and all of that stuff. So whatever notes and specs that we had that were used, and the prompts and stuff we gave to the main agents. I want to focus on that, so go ahead and move that stuff over there.


Okay, let's make another phase in the second project . This one's going to be for integrating the UI. , I guess, phase 7, in order to integrate the UI. So I'd like to take the existing clone page and add to it additional parameters for running the UI. Probably I'm thinking you're going to be able to add bands of compression (since we only have two types of compression, you can only add two bands). And then when you create one band, try to think how we want to limit it. Probably just keep it simple. Create one band where you automatically start at 0% and go to some percentage. Like you can enter the percentage that you go to. Whatever you choose will automatically set the start of your second band. So, essentially, you just have two numbers to set:
1. One for the first band
2. One for the second band
If you don't set them, then you don't do any compression.And then, as you set them, the label below those two numbers that you fill in the labels below that will reflect what the bands look like if it's valid. If you try to submit and it's not valid, then because the bands don't break down right, yeah, it will be common sense that the bands don't overlap. And then yeah, I think it's just going to default to:
- The first band is going to default to heavy compression
- The second band is going to default to compressionThis might still be throwaway a little bit, so we won't get to it. Because I feel like it's all going to change, so I'm not going to. I could make it more flexible, but I think that's probably sufficient for now. Let's also put in a checkbox to do a debug log. If you put the checkbox in UI, you get the debug log, and then you also get a link to the debug log. And let's put the debug log. Let's now make it an HTML output. Just a very simple HTML output. If you choose to do it from here, we can talk about how because we probably still want markdown from a regular command line. But it could be handy. Actually, no, no. Let's leave it markdown. We're going to leave it markdown and you just link the markdown, but you do copy the markdown into the web app. It will copy the markdown into the HTML, and it will now be part of the static files that are downloadable. Do you have any other questions before we go ahead and turn this into a spec? I think we can probably just turn it into a spec because it's not really a new capability, it's just wiring up the capability we were building as part of this feature. Any more questions before you turn it into a spec? Into a first draft of a spec, anyway?


On the validation feedback, I don't want it to be too fiddly in the JavaScript, but basic feedback as you go makes sense. Just gotta be careful not to do it where you have any kind of modals or pop-ups or prevent them from moving on or anything. Just more like have a little red text that pops up below, indicating what the problems are as you're filling out the form, and then that'll just go away when you get rid of the problems. And when that's also there, you just disable submit. That's probably easy. Just above the submit have a simple line with a list of any problems. Yeah, you're going to put it into the HTML path, like where the public path and that and the UI is going to link to that path. Yeah, you also want all of the compression stats listed in the output. How hard would it be to put a progress bar in there as well? I don't want to do two. Yeah, maybe if I know we probably need to build that into the API, and I don't want to do API changes. So it either has to be a fake progress bar, or we can do some sort of loading spinner, or what I kind of like is the loading text with a shimmer. You can see some of that loading text with a shimmer on in the Kodi Fastify HTML and JavaScript, there's a way that's working that seems to work pretty well. It's essentially a rolling highlight of the text, like the colors go brighter as it rolls across. So there's a little chunk of the text that all gets highlighted, not highlighted as in the background highlighted, just that the color of the text gets brighter there and that extra bright color rolls across. So it really detects as it goes. Quick question on the tool thinking removal: What does the API take? Does it take only fixed values or can you pass in any numbers there? If the API will take arbitrary numbers, then I would say pass those in. Switch them over to integer text fields and then allow that to be set however you want to whatever number you want on each instead of the drop-down. If the back-end is hard-coded to those values, then I would say just leave that for now, and we'll change that later.

I wanted these two 2 previous projects created here: /Users/leemoore/code/codex-port-02/coding-agent-manager/docs
